# Coding Problems

## Objective

This assignment aims to demonstrate how to study a data structures or algorithms question in depth to prepare for an industry coding interview.

## Group Size

Please complete this individually.

## Outline

### Part 1:

Below is a table of problems from a popular coding practice site, Leetcode. You will need to create a free account of access the problems. You will randomly pick 2 questions from the table. These questions may involve any topic before and including lecture 4.

| [One](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)                                       | [Five](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)                          | [Nine](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/) | [Thirteen](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)           | [Seventeen](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)                     | [Twenty-one](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-middle-index-in-array/)                            |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|

| [Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-09)   | [Seven](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)              | [Eleven](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)                        | [Fifteen](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/) | [Nineteen](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)                 | [Twenty-three](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/solutions/)                             |
| [Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)                                    | [Eight](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/) | [Twelve](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups/)      | [Sixteen](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/)        | [Twenty](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)                 | [Twenty-four](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-09) |

### Part 2:

In two Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, one for each problem, write down the following:

-   Paraphrase the problem in your own words

-   Create 2 new examples of each problem

-   Code the solution in Python (code chunk). Try to find the best time and space complexity solution!

-   Explain why your solution works

-   Explain the problem’s and space complexity

-   Explain the thinking to an alternative solution (no coding required, but a classmate reading this should be able to code it up based off your text)

Alternatively, you may use a Quarto file, or Word document with code screenshotted. However, we highly recommended you learn how to use a Jupyter Notebooks.

Export each .ipynb file as a pdf. There are online converters, you can use the print option, or Google Collab has a printing feature. Please ensure all code and text is visible.

## Submission Requirements

Create and submit a public GitHub repository with the following:

-   Two PDFs of the problems you have solved

##Evaluation Criteria

-   Problem is accurately stated in the student’s own words

-   Two examples are correct and easily understandable

-   Correctness, time, and space complexity of the coding solution

-   Clarity in explaining why the solution works, its time and space complexity

-   Clarity in the proposal to the alternative solution
