    "My partner's solution of using the breadth-first traversal method works well and provides the expected output in both of their examples. Their code checks for duplicates when traversing nodes by using a combination of a set and a queue to keep track of the values and nodes visited. Furthermore, my partner suggested an alternative solution to address the same problem by using the pre-order depth-first traversal algorithm, which entails checking the current node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. Essentially, the concept of this alternative approach is to explore one branch fully before moving onto the next branch. \n",

    "In this case in which we are simply checking for duplicates, I believe my partner's use of the breadth-first traversal graph algorithm was the better approach because in an uncomplicated graph, the breadth-first traversal algorithm is useful when looking for the shortest path between these nodes or for minimally spanning trees, which matches the examples used in our assignment. Therefore, the use of this algorithm would contribute to faster time to receive an output, i.e. this solution seems to be more efficient. In the example I provided, I attempted to use the depth-first algorithm. However, I agree with their approach and would not suggest making any adjustments. "

    "In Assignment 1, I answered Question 3, which involved writing a function that finds missing numbers in a list of integers. I attempted to carefully read the problem statement, and understanding the input and expected output. I then reviewed applicable content that included reviewing class lectures and notes, brainstormed possible approaches through hands-on coding, troubleshoot the many coding errors, and continued this iterative process until I came up with a solution that provided the expected results. Throughout the coding process, I attempted to ensure my solution was readable and well-documented. I also reviewed the time and space complexity for the problem and learned more about alternative approaches to address the same problem. I ultimately utilized a set-based algorithm, which allowed me to efficiently identify missing numbers by comparing the input list to a set of expected numbers. I also considered alternative solutions, including a boolean array algorithm, which could provide a more space-efficient approach.\n",
